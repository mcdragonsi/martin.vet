I decided a while ago I will resist that temptation to put the cookie consent on the website as it has proven to be completely unusable, unfriendly and most visitors see it as spam.
If you want to see which tracking is on my site here it is. Its basically just your bog standard Google tracking for the purposes of seeing who comes to visit the website. It also has a Statcounter tracker that helps me see the same thing.
