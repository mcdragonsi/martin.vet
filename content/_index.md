Iâ€™m **Martin McDowell DrVetMed**, an experienced small animal veterinary surgeon offering vet locum services round the UK but preferably in Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Shropshire and south Wales.

If you would require my locum services or would like more information, please get in touch with me through the contact form or directly via my email me@martin.vet. My CV and references are available on request.

### Experience
I have {{% years-till-today 2005 %}} years of experience in practising small animal veterinary medicine both in the UK and abroad. I worked for 5 years in a small animal practice in Wales until 2012, after which I started locuming full-time across the UK until December 2019 when I was offered a position as a Clinical Director in Herefordshire just in time for the COVID-19 pandemic to strike.

Although I have a photo of a lovely tawny owl on this page I do not usually see exotics.
