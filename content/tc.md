If the invoice is not paid within 14 days, then I will be entitled to charge interest on amounts outstanding beyond 14 days at 8% above the Bank of England's base rate. In addition to the interest a fixed fee in the amount of £40 (for invoices below £1000.00) or £70 (for invoices of £1000 and above) will be added to the late payment  charge.

I do not accept cheques.
