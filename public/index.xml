      <description>My name is Martin and I started this blog in about 2006. The OK Go post was my very first. It was on Google&amp;rsquo;s platform Blogger. I then migrated to Wordpress on different service providers: Bluehost, Webhosting UK and OVH. I finally broke free of Worpdress and moved to a static website platform. Hugo in this case. The CDN is hosted by Netlify, the photos are hosted on AWS S3 and the domain managed by Cloudflare.</description>
